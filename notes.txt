First idea was to make this app be multi-page--have different cards,
and when you click a job listing card, it would take you to a page with that job's 
description.

Second idea: have it be a single-page application that starts with a search, and when you
hit search it moves the searchbar to the top of the screen and populates the page below with 
the job cards and  the other things scraped from the listings page, like a footer.

The search would remain at the top so they could re-do their search if they want.

The job cards, when clicked, would expand to show the description of that job, unless
it turned out the link was to a listing on a different site, in which case it would just 
redirect the user to that site. 

(I need to test this with a link that I know goes to an external site)
